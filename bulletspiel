Abolish social media. Spiel.
NAAAAAAAACH *cut to logo* - Spiel
Decentralizing party culture.
Going to take off in America. More eccentrism.
Promoting happiness.
Week-long parties, life is a party.
Two-people parties, party is within oneself.
Centralize services, decentralize reality.
Spiel-bike, Spiel-biel, Spiel-haus, Spiel-clothes.

First rent Spielhauses, then buy them. Decentralize by becoming pseudostate.
Continue this behavior. Rebel against corporalism through decentralized success.
